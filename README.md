#### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ahmed Ali. I live in the northern area of Pakistan. Growing up, I was very curious about how games are developed, and this led me to enroll in software engineering.

In 2017, I joined a local software house as an intern, where I worked on backend (Node.js), web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and Android Development (Java).

In 2018, I got to know about freelancing, and I took it as an opportunity to implement my learnings in real-world projects. I started with Android Development, and soon after, my clients wanted me to develop iOS apps for them, so I worked on both iOS and Android. The freelancing journey helped me understand how to extract requirements from clients, how to start a new project and complete it, and how to work on tight deadlines.

In January 2021, when the restrictions for Covid-19 were over, I joined a physical software house in the capital city of Pakistan, Islamabad. It was an on-site job. Since I had both Android and iOS experience, I was basically considered the Team Lead. I worked with the project manager to mature Jira tasks, assigned tasks to my team (three Android and three iOS developers, including myself), conducted daily standups, and gave demos to the client.

In July 2022, I got the opportunity to join Modus Create as a remote iOS Developer. Modus Create is an international organization, so I learned a lot about diversity and how to work with different time zones.

So this is my story. Thank you for hearing it. In the last six years, I have worked on iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter. I believe in continuous learning. I thrive on challenges.

### Hello, I'm Ahmed Ali 👋

#### About Me
I am an iOS 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 6 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞. Growing up, I was very curios about how games are developed, which led me to enroll in a software engineering degree.

In 2018, I learned about freelancing and saw it as an opportunity to implement my mobile development skills on real projects. I developed several iOS and Android apps using Java, Kotlin, Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. 

In January 2021, after COVID, I joined Buzzware Tech to work on the Smart Tracker iOS app for Vodafone Qatar. It was an on-site job, where I learned how to work in a team, share my knowledge with teammates, and learn from them.

In July 2022, I joined Modus Create. I am working as Senior iOS Developer on the Alamo Drafthouse iOS app. Modus Create is an international organization, so I learned a lot about diversity.

I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously seek to enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects. I am open to new opportunities and may need visa/relocation support.
